Unofficial instagram API, give you access to ALL instagram features (like, follow, upload photo and video and etc)! Write on python.

This is python port of https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API, written on PHP. Work in progress to copy all functional...

Now InstagramAPI.py can:

1) Login;

2) Get feed by tag;

3) Like media;

Original contains more than 1500 rows, I will be glad if you could help me! The hardest part is done - it left to rewrite a bunch of features that simply. Thank you!
